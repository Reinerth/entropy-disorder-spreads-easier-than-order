<br><br><br>
I am not a physician or a math-expert, but it is not that difficult to understand,<br> 
that building a house of cards, is much harder than destroying it.<br> 
Or the same with the famous rubik-cube, <br>
which I still haven't figured out how to put those damn colors back in place.<br>
That all finally seems to mean, that disorder spreads easier than order.<br><br><br>

The main reason for this problem might be: we cant remember the way back. <br>
Means, all the footsteps we have walked till the reached point of disorder, <br>
are gone with the wind. <br><br><br>

So if I would remember the path I walked to disorder them, <br>
(here in my script I could do that, by saving the steps somehow in a list)<br>
I could reorder them, with the "same" amount of steps that I needed to disorder them. <br>
But still the problem is there because remembering the path costs extra moves. <br>
At least on binary level.<br><br><br>


Just for fun I wanted to verify the theory by myself. <br>
I tried to find a way, to order things, <br>
with less action moves, than I needed to disorder them. <br><br><br>

For that I made a list of numbers which initially are sorted. <br>
Then I mix them and count the moves I needed for that.<br>
While a move is one step in a loop (of course on binary level would be much more).<br>
Finally I applied different ways of sorting the numbers back. <br>
And again I counted the moves that I needed, to put them back to the place they belong.<br><br><br>

In reality that would be something like:<br>
I have an amount of number-cards in my hand (sorted)<br>
and I throw them on the floor. <br>
Then I pick them up one by one into my hand, <br>
and place them to those already in my hand, to the place where they belong. <br>
And count the moves for doing that. <br><br><br>


A philosophical difference I found between reality and script:<br>
In reality we dont need to mix the cards with our hands, <br>
with one single move we could let the cards fall down to get mixed.<br>
In script (or math) we need to take every number one by one to put it somewhere else.<br>
In math there is no gravity and wind that would do the action moves instead.<br>
Would be not easy to count those fuzzy wind-moves. <br><br><br>

The number of steps for mixing in script might be reduced more,<br>
but in the end it's just a matter of showing that the number for sorting<br>
cannot be smaller than the number for mixing.<br><br><br>


The script-code is not well-written or well-structured, because not in the focus here. <br>
The focus are (the difference of) the amounts of action moves for ordering and disordering, <br>
displayed in red in the output.<br><br>

The goal: to understand the problem.
