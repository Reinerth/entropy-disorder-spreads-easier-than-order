I am not a physician or a math-expert, but it is not that difficult to understand,<br>
that building a house of cards, is much harder than destroying it.<br>
Or the same with the famous rubik-cube,<br>
which I still not figured out how to put those f***g colors back on their place.<br>
That all finally seems to mean, that disorder spreads easier than order.
<br><br>
Just for fun I wanted to verify the theory by myself.<br>
I tried to find a way, to order things,<br>
with less action moves, than I needed to disorder them.
<br><br>
For that I made a list of numbers which initially are sorted.<br>
Than I mix them and count the moves I needed for that.<br>
While a move is one step in a loop (of course on binary level would be much more).<br>
Finally I applied different ways of sorting the numbers back.<br>
And again I counted the moves that I needed to put them back to the place they belong.
<br><br>
In reality that would be something like:<br>
I have an amount of number-cards in my hand (sorted)<br>
and I throw them on the floor.<br>
Then I pick them up one by one into my hand,<br>
and place them to those already in my hand, to the place where they belong.<br>
And count the moves for doing that.
<br><br>
A small philosophical difference I found between reality and script.<br>
In reality we need only one single move to let the cards fall down and get mixed,<br>
while in script (or math) we need to take every number one by one to put it somewhere else,<br>
due to the missing gravity and wind in math that make the action moves instead of our hands.<br>
Not easy to count those moves. However, it's just a simple example for fun.
<br><br>
The script-code is not well-written or well-structured, because not in the focus here.<br>
The focus are (the difference of) the amounts of action moves for ordering and disordering,<br>
displayed in red in the output.<br>
